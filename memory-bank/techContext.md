# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

*   **[Zcashd](https://github.com/zcash/zcash):** Is the legacy Zcash full-node client software being replaced by the Z3 stack
*   **[Zebra](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra):** A full-node implementation of the Zcash protocol that provides consensus and network functionalities in Rust.  Zebra has been under development by the Zcash Foundation since 2020 and is presently deployed by a number of decentralized node operators on mainnet.
*   **[Zaino](https://github.com/zingolabs/zaino/):** An indexing service that provides light clients with blockchain data, replacing the legacy go light client server lightwalletd. Zaino is under active development by Zingo Labs, funded by a grant from [ZCG](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/).
*   **[Zallet](https://github.com/zcash/wallet):** A CLI wallet that provides wallet functionality that existed in Zcashd but is not planned for implementation in Zebra.  Zallet is under active development by the Electric Coin Company.
*   **Rust:** Primary language for Zebra, Zaino, and Zallet (version TBD). Justification: Security, performance, and memory safety.
*   **gRPC:** In consideration for communication between Zebra and Zaino (version TBD). Justification: Efficient and standardized RPC framework.
*   **Docker:** For deployment and containerization (version TBD). Justification: Consistent and reproducible environments.

## Development Setup

*   **Rust toolchain:** Requires a recent version of the Rust toolchain, including `rustc`, `cargo`, and `clippy`.
*   **Docker:** Requires Docker for building and running the services.
*   **Git:** Requires Git for version control.
*   **Editor:** VSCode with Rust Analyzer extension recommended.

## Technical Constraints

*   **Performance:** The system must be able to handle high transaction volumes and provide low-latency access to blockchain data.
*   **Security:** Security is paramount, and all components must be designed to resist attacks.
*   **Compatibility:** The system must be compatible with the Zcash protocol and network.
