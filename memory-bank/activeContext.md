## Next Steps

Review and update the `progress.md` file to reflect the current state of the project.

## Active Decisions

No active decisions are currently being made.

## Important Patterns

The importance of maintaining a comprehensive and up-to-date Memory Bank is a key pattern for this project. All decisions and changes should be documented in the Memory Bank to ensure consistency and knowledge sharing.

## Learnings and Insights

The project brief provides a good overview of the project's goals and requirements, which is essential for making informed decisions. The modular architecture of the system allows for independent development and deployment of components.
