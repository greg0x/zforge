# Active Context

## Current Focus

Updating the Memory Bank, specifically reviewing and updating the core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`).

## Recent Changes

Updated the `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` files with information about the project's problems, proposed solution, user experience goals, system architecture, technologies used, and development setup. The `productContext.md` file was further updated to refine the "User Experience Goals" section and add a "Key Metrics" section. The `systemPatterns.md` file was updated to reflect the user's interaction with the Z3 wrapper service and the potential communication paths between Zallet, Zaino, and Zebra. The `systemPatterns.md` file was further updated to rename "Wrapper Service" to "Z3 wrapper service". The `techContext.md` file was updated to include links to the repositories for Zebra, Zaino, and Zallet, and to provide more detailed information about dependencies and tool usage patterns.

## Next Steps

Review and update the `progress.md` file to reflect the current state of the project.

## Active Decisions

No active decisions are currently being made.

## Important Patterns

The importance of maintaining a comprehensive and up-to-date Memory Bank is a key pattern for this project. All decisions and changes should be documented in the Memory Bank to ensure consistency and knowledge sharing.

## Learnings and Insights

The project brief provides a good overview of the project's goals and requirements, which is essential for making informed decisions. The modular architecture of the system allows for independent development and deployment of components.
