# Progress

## Working Functionality

1. **Memory Bank:**
   - Core files actively maintained and updated
   - New z3_docker.md documents containerization findings
   - RPC mapping documented and service assignments agreed upon

2. **Docker Configuration:**
   - Zebra's Docker setup analyzed and documented
     - Multi-stage Dockerfile with test/runtime stages
     - Multiple compose files for different scenarios
     - Production-ready security features
   - Zaino's Docker configuration examined
     - Multi-stage build process
     - TOML-based configuration
     - gRPC service exposure

3. **Integration Planning:**
   - Unified Docker Compose draft completed
   - Volume management strategy defined
   - Network architecture planned
   - Security considerations documented

## Functionality Left To Build

1. **Docker Integration:**
   - Research and document Zallet's Docker requirements
   - Create production Docker Compose with all components
   - Implement monitoring and health checks
   - Develop backup/restore procedures
   - Create deployment documentation

2. **Software Stack Development:**
   - Complete [Zebra Ready for zcashd Deprecation milestone](https://github.com/orgs/ZcashFoundation/projects/9/views/11)
   - Continue Zaino development as Lightwalletd replacement
   - Progress Zallet development
   - Build Z3 wrapper service for unified RPC routing

3. **Production Readiness:**
   - Implement security hardening
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Create disaster recovery procedures
   - Document operational procedures

## Current Status

1. **Documentation Phase:**
   - Memory Bank established as knowledge repository
   - Docker orchestration plan documented in z3_docker.md
   - RPC routing assignments in progress

2. **Development Progress:**
   - Zebra: Docker configuration mature, ready for integration
   - Zaino: Docker setup analyzed, integration points identified
   - Zallet: Docker requirements to be researched
   - Z3 Wrapper: Architecture planning stage

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Complete Zallet Docker investigation
   - Implement unified Docker Compose
   - Set up monitoring infrastructure
   - Create deployment guides

## Known Issues

1. Some RPC method assignments still undecided between Zebra and Zaino
2. Monitoring and observability requirements need definition
3. Full integration testing plan needed for Docker deployment
4. Production backup procedures to be designed

## Evolution of Decisions

1. **RPC Service Mapping:**
   - Initial mapping complete with Zcashd Deprecation Team
   - Some methods still need final assignment
   - RPC support requirements documented in techContext.md

2. **Docker Architecture:**
   - Decision to use multi-stage builds for all components
   - Standardized security practices (non-root users, TLS)
   - Consistent volume management approach
   - Unified monitoring strategy planned

3. **Integration Strategy:**
   - Docker Compose as primary orchestration tool
   - Service discovery via Docker networking
   - TOML-based configuration management
   - Secure communication between components
