# Progress

## Working Functionality

The Memory Bank is functional and being actively maintained. The core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`) are being used to document the project.

## Functionality Left To Build

The entire software stack (Zebra, Zaino, Zallet, and the wrapper service) still needs to be built.

## Current Status

The project is in the initial planning and documentation phase. The Memory Bank is being established as a central repository for project knowledge. The core memory bank files have been reviewed and updated.

## Known Issues

No known issues at this time.

## Evolution of Decisions
