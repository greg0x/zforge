# Z3 Development Tools
# 
# Rust versions are managed by rust-toolchain.toml in each submodule.
# This file pins external tools only.
#
# Usage:
#   mise install    # Install pinned versions
#   mise trust      # Trust this config (first time only)

[tools]
# Protocol buffer compiler (for gRPC)
protobuf = "29"

# Process manager for running services
# Note: mise doesn't have overmind, install via:
#   brew install overmind (macOS)
#   go install github.com/DarthSim/overmind/v2@latest

[env]
# Ensure cargo uses the workspace target directory for shared builds
# (Each submodule still gets its own due to different rust-toolchain.toml)
