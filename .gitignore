#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
#.idea/

# Ignore all contents of the 'config' directory recursively
config/**
!config/zallet.toml

# Un-ignore the 'tls' subdirectory itself, so we can look inside it
!config/tls/

# Then ignore everything inside 'tls'
config/tls/*

# Then un-ignore the .gitkeep file within 'tls'
!config/tls/.gitkeep

# Un-ignore .gitkeep directly under config
!config/.gitkeep
